Harvardx Data Science Project

This project contains four main files:

1). 01_pre_processing.R = This code is just for illustration purposes so the reader can look to some of the data wrangling steps performed.

2). 02_tax_expectation.R = This code is contains the core of the project, from the creation of train and test sets to ML algorithms implementation.

3). tax_expectation.Rmd = This rmd file needs the project downloaded from GitHub in order to run properly (figs and rda). The instructions are explained in the first chunk "setup".

3). movielens_final.pdf = This is the pdf knitted with R markdown (.Rmd file). 

First, you must run the 02_tax_expectation.R script since some objects of the .Rmd file are created with the R script. While running it, you can read the corresponding sections in the PDF file (these sections are indicated as footnotes in the PDF).
